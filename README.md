# Project-6-Battery-Tester
This project's purpose is to test the battery to see if it is good, sufficient, or bad. 
Good is signified by the green LED being lit up. The original code had the threshold at 1.6v but I lowered it to 1.2v.
Sufficient is signified by yellow. Threshold was changed to 1.0v to <1.2v.
Bad is signified by red. Threshold was changed to <1.0v.
